I'm currently a junior at UHM majoring in Management Information Systems, Finance, International Business and minoring in Economics.
The reason for doing a triple and a minor? I couldn't choose what to do. Why pick when you can just try to do them all? 

My job has requires that I do a lot of data testing so I'm familiar with some of the coding lingo. On the side, I'm also attempting to learn Python. 

My hobbies currently include: swimming, reading, and eating. Currently my favorite restaurant is probably The Nook, which is down University Ave. They make amazing eggs benedicts and have a great selection of teas.
